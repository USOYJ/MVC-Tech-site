# Barbie Blog
The Barbie blog is a CMS-style blog site that allow anyone who identify as a "barb" to publish articles, post thoughts and opinions, Barbie the movie is such an inspirational movie with a very powerful message, my expectation for the movie was that it would be very superficial or just a feelgood movie but No! Such an amazing movie and that inspired me to build a Barbie themed blog.
